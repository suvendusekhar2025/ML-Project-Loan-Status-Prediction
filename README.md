# ML-Project-Loan-Status-Prediction
Description:
Developed a **Loan Status Prediction** model using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify loan approvals based on applicant details. Utilized a dataset with **614 rows and 13 columns** in CSV format,
applying **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data preprocessing and analysis. Employed **Seaborn** for data visualization to identify key trends and correlations.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using **sklearn.model_selection** and evaluated model performance with **sklearn.metrics**,
achieving **83.3% accuracy on test data** and **79.9% on training data**.
